## Execution 
For better project execution, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. To install it: 
 
```
pip install virtualenv 
```
 
 
- Create a virtual environment: 
 
```
virtualenv venv 
 ```
 
 
- Activate the virtual environment: 
 
```
source venv/bin/activate 
 ```
 
 
- After activating the virtual environment, there is a `.txt` file containing the required libraries and frameworks embedded. Install it within the virtual environment: 
 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
 ```
 
 
- Once the project dependencies are installed, run the project: 
 
```
python manage.py runserver 
 ```
